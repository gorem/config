## Config

This repo contains various configuration files I use repeatedly, including different versions for different operating systems. Iâ€™m close to being Mac-only for personal stuff, so those files get updated the most.

### Mac
* **zshrc.zsh**: My oh-my-zsh-based ~/.zshrc for macOS.

* **journal.py**: I keep a daily journal; this script (along with the jr function in ~/.zshrc) helps get me started with the date, time, location, and cursor in the right place to just type.

* **gitconfig** and **gitignore**: Configuration files for git.

### Ubuntu
* **setup.sh**: My favorite file in here, which I hope still works; sets up Ubuntu the way I like it.

### iOS
* **journal.py**: A Pythonista script I use to write in my journal on iOS in iA Writer.

### Windows
* Files in support of using my journal tool on Windows. I have a version for WSL and one for PowerShell.

### Editors
* **vimrc.vim**: My .vimrc. Probably more comfortable with vim than emacs now.

* **VSCode-settings.json**: This is my settings.json for Visual Studio Code, which I really like. Wish a new window opened faster on Macs, though.

### Archives
* **emacs.el**: My .emacs file for Macs and Linux.

* **win-emacs.el**: Windows-friendly version of my .emacs file.

* **fedora-setup.sh**: Fedora is fast and awesome, so here's a quick setup script for it. That said, I've switched back to Ubuntu since it's more familiar and I don't use Linux a ton, anyway.

* **linux-bash-aliases.bash**: This is the Linux version of my old Mac .bash_profile, but at this point, I use oh-my-zsh on Linux, too.

* **work-phone.bash**: Old bash function I used at a previous job for looking up phone numbers.

* **mac-bash-profile.bash**: My old .bash_profile for macOS.

* **timer.sh**: A janky bash script/countdown timer I used in grad school rather than blow $3 or whatever on a Pomodoro timer in the Mac App Store.
